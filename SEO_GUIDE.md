# SEO Implementation Guide

## What Was Added

Your blog now has comprehensive SEO optimization including:

1. **Automatic Sitemap Generation** - `/sitemap.xml` (auto-generated by jekyll-sitemap)
2. **Robots.txt** - Guides search engine crawlers
3. **Open Graph Meta Tags** - Rich previews on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
4. **Twitter Card Meta Tags** - Rich previews on Twitter/X
5. **Meta Descriptions** - Search engine result snippets
6. **Structured Data (Schema.org)** - Helps search engines understand your content
7. **Author Meta Tags** - Attribution and authorship

## How to Use SEO Features in Your Posts

### Basic Post (Minimum Required)

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
category: Tech
---
```

The SEO system will automatically:
- Use the first 160 characters of your post as the meta description
- Use your site's default image for social sharing
- Generate proper Open Graph and Twitter Card tags
- Create structured data for search engines

### Enhanced Post (Recommended)

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
category: Tech
tag: Featured
description: "A custom 150-160 character description that appears in search results and social media previews."
image: /assets/images/your-image.png
---
```

**Best Practices:**
- **description**: 150-160 characters, compelling summary of your post
- **image**: Optimal size is 1200x630px for social sharing
- **title**: Keep under 60 characters for best search result display

## How It Works

### Meta Descriptions
The system prioritizes in this order:
1. Custom `description` in front matter
2. Auto-generated from post excerpt (first 160 chars)
3. Site description from `_config.yml`

### Social Sharing Images
The system prioritizes in this order:
1. Custom `image` in front matter
2. Default site icon (`/public/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png`)

### Structured Data
For blog posts, the system automatically generates Schema.org BlogPosting markup including:
- Headline, description, and image
- Publication date
- Author information
- Publisher details

## What Gets Generated

When someone shares your post on social media or it appears in search results, they'll see:

**Search Results (Google):**
```
Your Post Title - Hanyu
[Your meta description appears here...]
https://blog.hanyutang-sandra.site/...
```

**Social Media (Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn):**
```
[Your featured image]
Your Post Title
Your meta description
blog.hanyutang-sandra.site
```

## Next Steps

1. A compelling `description` (150-160 chars)
2. An engaging `image` if available
3. That's it! Everything else is automatic.
