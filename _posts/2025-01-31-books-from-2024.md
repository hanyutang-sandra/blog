At the start of 2024, I made a promise to myself to improve my reading habits and rescue my dwindling attention span from the clutches of mindless scrolling through Instagram reels and TikTok videos. To support this, I kept my Kindle charged and in pocket as much as possible. Despite all this effert, in true deserter fashion *(kidding!)*, I began numerous books but only finished 20% of them. Here are a few:

#### The forever Dog

###### by Karen Shaw Becker and Rodney Habib

*"Oh the things we do for our dogs"*

A guide book to teach dog owners how to delay aging and providing a long, happy, healthy life for dogs. I love the book does **not** fall into the common pitfalls of modern extremism - either 100% organic fresh food or low-quality, stale kibbles. Instead, it teaches the ideal of "better little than not" - making small improvements and changes day by day.

#### The Caregiver's Guide to Cancer

###### by Victoria Landes LCSW

*"I wish no one ever needs to read this book"*

In the one month when I became a cancer caregiver to my mother, this small book provided help and much needed comfort. The book, narrated in a calm tone, somehow gives me the stability to carry on amid the sudden storm brought by the untimely and cruel disease. I was able to put many tips, especially the ones involving mental health both for the cancer patient and the caregiver, into practice. However, the book is written based on the US medical system and does not apply to other countries.

#### Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow

**by Gabrielle Zevin**

*"Games, and etc."*

I'm not a ***hardcore*** gamer, but I do play games from time to time. While my game development experience is limited to Unity 3D and C#, I find the subject fascinating. The book revolves around themes of friendship and, perhaps, a touch of love, set against the captivating backdrop of video game design. Its narrative follows a female game designer as she navigates the complexities of life, work, hobbies, and love. As a woman working in tech myself, I find her journey both inspiring and somewhat relatable.

#### The Talented Mr. Ripley

**by Patricia Highsmith**

*"Netflix overdue"*

I was drawn to this book because of the Netflix show **Ripley**. I loved its gray-toned visuals, the artistic aesthetic, the slow, deliberate storytelling, and Andrew Scott's brilliant performance. However, I didn't finish the book as something else eventually drew my attention away.

#### The Midnight Library

**By Matt Haig**

*"What is a good life"*

When Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library, she‚Äôs given the chance to rewrite her life. Up until now, her days have been clouded by misery and regret. But within the endless shelves of the Midnight Library, she gets to explore different versions of her life, each shaped by the choices she made differently. Throughout these lives, she experiences both love and loss. The ultimate question remains: What truly makes a life worth living? I love the book‚Äôs premise, but ***(spoiler alert)*** the loss of her pet hit a little too close to home.

#### The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness and Effectiveness

**By Epictetus, Sharon Lebell (Retold by)**

*"Philosophy about life"*

After delving into the meaning of life with **The Midnight Library**, I decided to explore more classic works, beginning with Epictetus‚Äôs original writings. Unfortunately, I found it a bit too challenging.

#### A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy

**By William B. Irvine**

*"An easier philosophical book"*

I started the book in December and hadn‚Äôt finished the first chapter by the time I wrote this blog. It begins with a history of the Stoic academy, which feels more approachable compared to the dense, serious philosophical texts that follow.
