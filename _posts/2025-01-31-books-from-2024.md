At the start of 2024, I made a promise to myself to improve my reading habits and rescue my dwindling attention span from the clutches of mindless scrolling through Instagram reels and TikTok videos. To support this, I kept my Kindle charged and in my pocket as much as possible. Despite all this effert, in true deserter fashion (kidding!), I began numerous books but only finished 20% of them. However, on a positive note, I managed to complete several books that I had started the previous year, bringing my total book count for 2024 to 10 - not a lot, but still a significant improvement compared to my previous record.

#### The forever Dog

###### by Karen Shaw Becker and Rodney Habib

*"Oh the things we do for our dogs"*

A guide book to teach dog owners how to delay aging and providing a long, happy, healthy life for dogs. I love the book does **not** fall into the common pitfalls of modern extremism - either 100% organic fresh food or low-quality, stale kibbles. Instead, it teaches the ideal of "better little than not" - making small improvements and changes day by day.

#### The Caregiver's Guide to Cancer

###### by Victoria Landes LCSW

*"I wish nobody ever needs to read this book"*

In the one month when I became a cancer caregiver to my mother, this small book provided help and much needed comfort. The book, narrated in a calm tone, somehow gives me the stability to carry on amid the sudden storm brought by the untimely and cruel disease. I was able to put many tips, especially the ones involving mental health both for the cancer patient and the caregiver, into practice. The only downside I find is that the book is written based on the US medical system and does not apply to other countries.
