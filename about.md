Hello~ My name is **Hanyu Tang**. Welcome to my blog site 🙌🏻.

I'm currently Software Engineer 👩🏻‍💻 based in San Francisco. I used to work in Web Fullstack 🕸 but recently I'm working on iOS 📱 a lot. That being said, I still love Web and build web projects from time to time (like this blog). 

The blog is my first try in writing technical content outside work environment. English is not my first language so you may find spelling and grammar mistakes here and there. Like me know if you ever found one, and I will get it fixed in no time ⌨️.
